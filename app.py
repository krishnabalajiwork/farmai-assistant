Tomato Disease Management:
1. Tomato Blight (Early Blight and Late Blight):
- Symptoms: Early blight appears as brown concentric spots primarily on older leaves; late blight causes dark water-soaked lesions usually on leaves and stems accompanied by white fungal growth under moist conditions.
- Causal Agents: Alternaria solani (early blight), Phytophthora infestans (late blight).
- Epidemiology: Both thrive in humid, warm conditions from 18 to 30Â°C; late blight spreads rapidly during cool, wet weather.
- Management Strategy:
  A. Use certified disease-free seeds and resistant varieties like 'Roma VF' and 'Cherry VF'.
  B. Employ crop rotation and avoid planting solanaceous plants consecutively.
  C. Implement fungicide schedules starting at first symptom detection, favoring copper-based fungicides and systemic protectants.
  D. Maintain adequate spacing for airflow; prune lower leaves to prevent humidity buildup.
  E. Irrigate at soil level, avoiding leaf wetness.

2. Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV):
- Symptoms: Mottled light and dark green leaf patterns, leaf curling, stunting, reduced fruit yield.
- Transmission: Mechanical injury, aphids, farm tools.
- Control Measures:
  A. Destroy infected plants immediately.
  B. Clean tools and equipment regularly.
  C. Use resistant cultivars and virus-free seeds.
  D. Control aphid vector populations with insecticides or biological controls like lady beetles.

3. Fusarium Wilt:
- Characterized by vascular discoloration and wilting.
- Soilborne fungus persists in soil for several years.
- Control by soil solarization, resistant cultivars, and organic amendments.

4. Whitefly Management:
- Whiteflies cause direct feeding damage and transmit Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus.
- Control through yellow sticky traps, biological agents (Encarsia spp., Eretmocerus spp.), and insecticidal soaps.

5. Nutrient Management:
- Balanced fertilization with potassium to enhance plant resistance.
- Avoid excess nitrogen which promotes vegetative growth susceptible to fungal infection.

6. Post-Harvest Disease Management:
- Proper sanitation of storage facilities.
- Use of fungicide treatments on harvested fruits before storage.
